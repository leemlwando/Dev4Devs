# Dev4Devs: Zambian Digital Awards Platform

**Dev4Devs (Development for Developers)** is an open-source, community-driven initiative to discover, promote, and celebrate active digital products, startups, and open-source projects originating from Zambia.

Our mission is to shine a light on Zambian tech innovation, built by developers for developers.

## üéØ The Vision

Every year, Zambian developers, designers, and technologists build impactful apps and platforms‚Äîbut many remain undiscovered. Dev4Devs aims to create a central hub to:
* **Discover:** Unearth the amazing digital products being built in Zambia.
* **Nominate:** Allow the community to put forward deserving projects and individuals.
* **Vote:** Enable peer and public recognition through a transparent voting process.
* **Celebrate:** Honor the best of Zambia‚Äôs digital innovation.

## üß© The Problem We're Solving

* **Limited Visibility:** Many Zambian-built apps, websites, and open-source projects lack widespread recognition.
* **Unseen Talent:** Skilled student developers and dedicated open-source contributors often go unacknowledged.
* **Recognition Void:** There's no central, accessible platform for nationwide peer recognition driven by the developer community itself.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Planned)

* **Nomination System:** Open to the community to nominate active Zambian digital products.
* **Voting Mechanism:** Verified public voting, with potential for expert panel input.
* **Project Showcases:** Detailed profiles for nominees (description, tech stack, links).
* **Diverse Award Categories:** Recognizing excellence in areas like UI/UX, functionality, innovation, and student projects.
* **Digital Awards & Recognition:** Celebrating winners and promoting their work.
